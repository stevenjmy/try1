    <p>Urban Transformation is a response to redevelopment strategies meeting all requirements for the future.</p>
      <article1>Civic Link is 490m long and 20m wide, connecting from the Parramarra Square to River Square. It will support 
       liveability by creating a pedestrain and cycle-friendly avenue through Parramatta CBD, fitting for the increased population 
       of Parramatta. It will support sustainability by creating a green public space in order to against side effects of climate 
       change, collect stormwater, and satisfy the infrastructure needs. It will support productivity by linking the heritages and 
       developing new art and culture precincts. Its linkage provides opportunities to share culture, knowledge, and experiences for 
       creative and active people in Parramatta.
